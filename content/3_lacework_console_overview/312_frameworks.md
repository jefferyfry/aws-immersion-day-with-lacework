The Frameworks menu item allows you to create your own CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) framework. This enables you to define your own security controls using existing policies or creating your own. You can clone from an existing
framework such as CIS AWS, PCI DSS, etc. and modify it to suit your needs.

1. In the Lacework Console, navigate to **Frameworks**.
2. Select **Add Framework**.
3. Select an existing framework to clone from.
4. Modify the framework to suit your needs by adding your own sections and/or adding removing policies.
