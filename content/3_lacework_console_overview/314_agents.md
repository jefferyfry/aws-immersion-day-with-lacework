The Agents menu item allows you to view the agents that are installed on your hosts. This enables you to see the details of the agents including status.

An agent provides threat detection, file integrity monitoring, vulnerability detection, and host-based intrusion detection for your Cloud or on-premises Windows, Linux and Kubernetes based workloads.

After you install the agent, the agent and the Lacework server (API endpoint) communicate with each other. The agent scans your hosts and securely forwards select metadata to the Lacework server to build a baseline of normal behavior. From this, Lacework provides alerts for anomalous behavior.
