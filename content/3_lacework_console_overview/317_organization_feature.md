Lacework's Organization feature allows you to manage multiple teams and accounts in a single Lacework Console. This feature is useful for organizations that have multiple accounts across different teams and control access and visibility. You can manage all your teams and accounts from a single Lacework Console. On AWS, it is common to map to AWS Organizations and accounts.
