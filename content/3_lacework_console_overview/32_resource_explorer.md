Resource Explorer is a security tool that grants you visibility into your multi-cloud environments and their resources and risks. We offer support for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud environments and enable you to view, search, sort, and filter among all resources across these environmentsâ€”with no limit.

With security analysts in mind, resource Explorer introduces a new level of practicality with the following capabilities:

* Real-time resource monitoring: Provides immediate visibility into cloud resources, facilitating the prompt detection of unauthorized or suspicious activities.
* Unified security assessment: Consolidates cloud resources into a single view, aiding security analysts in assessing security posture comprehensively, identifying vulnerabilities, and efficiently recognizing compliance issues.
* Security management: Automates tracking and management of mission-critical resources, workloads, and accounts, enabling your security team to monitor, respond to, and secure these assets effectively. This enhances incident response capabilities and ensures adherence to security policies.

* Lacework inventories all of your cloud resources and tracks their configuration changes. This can help you determine if recent configuration changes are the source of issues.
