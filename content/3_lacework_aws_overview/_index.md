In this section, we will explore Lacework's advanced cloud security posture management (CSPM+) through an AWS S3 Ransomware attack. 
In this scenario, we will see how Lacework can detect S3 misconfigurations and alert you to the S3 vulnerability. In the 
case when no action is taken, you will see how Lacework's Polygraph technology detects the anomalous behavior and further enable you to
quickly investigate the activity.
