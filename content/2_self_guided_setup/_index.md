# Self-Guided Setup

Welcome to the Self Guided Setup section! This workshop requires an AWS account where there is IAM user/identity that has proper permissions to set up the necessary AWS components to work through the workshop. Worried about costs associated with this workshop? Don’t worry, there’s a page that will allow you to request for AWS credits to pay for any costs incurred through this workshop!


Here is a preview of what we will be setting up:

* Set up your AWS account and IAM roles.
* Provision a Cloud9 IDE instance.
* Get a JFrog Platform instance from the AWS Marketplace.
* Prepare our JFrog Platform instance.
* Clone our workshop GitHub repository which contains our code.
