Every activity within a cloud environment increases the potential for threats, and AWS users must have a solution that not only identifies changes, but understands the security context of them. To address the agile nature of the cloud, Lacework provides comprehensive, continuous end-to-end security and configuration support for workloads and accounts running in AWS cloud environments. In this section, we will explore how the Lacework platform integrates with AWS configuration, CloudTrail, agents and CI/CD in order to secure your cloud environments.
