# Cloud Activity

In this section, we will set up our CI/CD pipeline with JFrog Pipelines. Our pipeline, will take our application and build a docker image. Push it to a Docker repository. Scan it for security vulnerabilities. Then it will promote it. Finally, it will deploy it to our AWS EKS cluster.
