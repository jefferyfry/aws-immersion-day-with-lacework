You can validate the integration by checking the cloud accounts in your Lacework console. If you chose to monitor existing accounts, any ACTIVE AWS accounts will be added along with the master account for the centralized CloudTrail logging. Follow the next steps to verify the accounts.

1. Login to your Lacework Cloud Security Platform console.
2. Go to **Settings > Cloud Accounts**.
3. You should see a list of AWS accounts that are now being monitored by Lacework. The **Cloud Account** column values correspond to the AWS Account IDs.
