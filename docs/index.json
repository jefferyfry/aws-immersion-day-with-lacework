	"content": " AWS Immersion Day with Lacework Welcome The Lacework Cloud Security Platform delivers comprehensive and continuous end-to-end AWS security and configuration support for both workloads and accounts running in cloud environments. As more organizations move their critical workloads to the cloud, there is an increasing need for a single, unified solution like the Lacework Cloud Security Platform that can identify, analyze, and report on misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and behavioral anomalies in user and account behavior.\nIn this hands-on workshop, you will have the opportunity to explore the Lacework Cloud Security Platform and understand how it secures your AWS cloud environments.\nLearning Objectives  Understand Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and how Lacework monitors for cloud misconfigurations. Cloud and User Activity Monitoring\u0026hellip; Vulnerabilty Discovery and Workload Protection \u0026hellip;.  The examples and sample code provided in this workshop are intended to be consumed as instructional content. These will help you understand how various services can be architected to build a solution while demonstrating best practices along the way. These examples are not intended for use in production environments.\n "

Worried about costs associated with this workshop? Don’t worry, there’s a page that will allow you to request for AWS credits to pay for any costs incurred through this workshop!\nWhat We Will Do  Set up your AWS account and IAM roles. Provision a Cloud9 IDE instance.  "

The workshop script will provision the resources in this region.\n Navigate to the Cloud9 console or just search for it under the AWS services search.\n Click the Create environment button.\n For the name, enter jfrog-workshop and click Next Step.\n Select Other instance type and choose t3.medium.\n Leave all the other settings as default.\n Click Next Step.\n On the Review page, click Create environment. The Cloud9 environment will take a few minutes to provision.\n When the environment comes up, close the Welcome page tab.\n Close the lower work area tab.\n Open a new terminal tab in the main work area.\n  Your workspace should now look like this and can hide the left hand environment explorer by clicking on the left side environment tab.\n![c9after](/images/c9after.png) If you don\u0026rsquo;t like this dark theme, you can change it from the View ► Themes menu.\n Cloud9 requires third-party-cookies. You can whitelist the specific domains. You are having issues with this, Ad blockers, javascript disablers, and tracking blockers should be disabled for the Cloud9 domain, or connecting to the workspace might can be impacted.\n "
