	"content": " AWS Immersion Day with Lacework Welcome The Lacework Cloud Security Platform delivers comprehensive and continuous end-to-end AWS security and configuration support for both workloads and accounts running in cloud environments. As more organizations move their critical workloads to the cloud, there is an increasing need for a single, unified solution like the Lacework Cloud Security Platform that can identify, analyze, and report on misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and behavioral anomalies in user and account behavior.\nIn this hands-on workshop, you will have the opportunity to explore the Lacework Cloud Security Platform and understand how it secures your AWS cloud environments.\nLearning Objectives  Understand Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and how Lacework monitors for cloud misconfigurations. Cloud and User Activity Monitoring\u0026hellip; Vulnerabilty Discovery and Workload Protection \u0026hellip;.  The examples and sample code provided in this workshop are intended to be consumed as instructional content. These will help you understand how various services can be architected to build a solution while demonstrating best practices along the way. These examples are not intended for use in production environments.\n "
