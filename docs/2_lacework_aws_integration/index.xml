      <description>The Lacework platform platform at a minimum requires integration with the AWS configuration for an account in order to check security posture of resources. CloudTrail is recommended in order to monitor user, API and resource activity for suspicious behavior. AI/ML are applied to this activity in order to detect anomalous behavior.
Navigate to Settings &amp;gt; Integrations &amp;gt; Cloud Accounts in your console. Click + Add New. Select AWS. Select CloudTrail+Config or Config and click Next.</description>

      <description>With Lacework and AWS Control Tower, enrolling a new AWS account now means security best practices and monitoring are automatically applied consistently across your organization. Account administrators can automatically add Lacework&amp;rsquo;s security auditing and monitoring to AWS accounts seamlessly. All the required Lacework and AWS account configurations that allow access to AWS configuration and CloudTrail logs are managed for you by Lacework’s AWS Control Tower integration.
The Lacework AWS Control Tower integration audits and monitors AWS accounts in your AWS Control Tower Landing Zone.</description>

      <description>For hosts, container services and Kubernetes, optional agents can be installed to enable security monitoring at the edge of the cloud. Lacework agents are lightweight and send network and process telemetry for security analysis. Lacework agents are supported on most x86, ARM and container runtimes. The Lacework Agent also supports AWS Graviton processors and is AWS Graviton Ready. Deploying an agent requires an agent access token and using the installation method that is appropriate for your environment.</description>

      <title>Agentless Workload Scanning</title>
      <link>https://lacework-alliances.github.io/aws-immersion-day/2_lacework_aws_integration/24_agentless_workload_scanning.html</link>

      <guid>https://lacework-alliances.github.io/aws-immersion-day/2_lacework_aws_integration/24_agentless_workload_scanning.html</guid>
      <description>Agentless workload scanning enables you to quickly gain comprehensive visibility into vulnerability risks and secrets across your cloud workloads — without the need to install agents. With this option, you have more flexibility and choice to scan and detect vulnerabilities and secrets across all hosts and container images to meet your coverage needs.
Lacework&amp;rsquo;s agentless scanning technology is designed to be private by design. Snapshots are created in a customer account and then shared / copied to a customer managed cloud account.</description>

      <description>All Kubernetes activities, whether manual activities with the kubectl tool, or automated, results in one or more API calls to the Kubernetes API server. Lacework can ingest these events to monitor activities, including kubectl exec, port-forwarding, deployment of new resources such as workloads, Kubernetes roles and role bindings, deletion of resources, authentication issues, forbidden API calls, and more. The Lacework Polygraph Data Platform surface the most important events such as the execution of rogue containers, the deployment of misconfigured workloads, the addition of dangerous roles, or manual login to containers.</description>

      <description>If your development teams are doing microservices development and delivering container images, Lacework can be enabled to scan your images for software vulnerabilities. Lacework can scan OS and software packages and alert you to vulnerabilities. Lacework supports the most popular container registries including Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
Lacework also has a proxy scanner which allows Lacework to perform container vulnerability assessments for your on-premises Docker container image registries without exposing them to external connectivity.</description>

      <description>With Lacework, you can also discover software vulnerabilities during your software build process. This is done through use of the Lacework inline scanner. The Lacework inline scanner can be integrated with many CI/CD tools including AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild. You can see AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild examples in the DevSecOps modules. Similar to the container registry scanning, the inline scanner can detect software vulnerabilities in OS and software packages.The inline scanner is configured in the Container Registries settings menu:</description>
