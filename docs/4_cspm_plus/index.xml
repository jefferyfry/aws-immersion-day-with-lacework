      <description>
In this scenario, we simulate the typical ransomware actions where an attacker gains access to sensitive data.
An attacker gains access to a bastion host that is exposed to the internet. From the bastion host, the attacker scans for s3 buckets (using the preinstalled AWS CLI). The attacker discovers an S3 bucket with sensitive documents. The attacker uses encryption keys to encrypt the documents. </description>

      <description>Laceworkâ€™s AWS security platform automatically validates all configurations against the controls established as best practices for securing your cloud environment. The first step in preventing an attack is secure your cloud configuration. Lacework monitors your AWS environments and notifies you of security misconfigurations.
Go to Compliance &amp;gt; Cloud in the Lacework Console to display the Compliance page. Choose the Group by Policy. Then for Service Category filter choose S3. Click on LW_S3_2 Ensure the S3 bucket ACL does not grant &amp;lsquo;Everyone&amp;rsquo; WRITE permission [create, overwrite, and delete S3 objects].</description>

      <description>In the previous sections, we looked at prevention - identifying issues that make you vulnerable to an attack. Now we will look at Lacework&amp;rsquo;s anomaly detection events with Polygraph. The Lacework Polygraph analyzes an array of cloud factors to detect breaches. There are currently six Lacework polygraph analysis groups:
Application/process communications Application launches Machine communications Machine servers Privilege changes Insider behaviors Click on this CloudTrail Dossier that represents malicious activity from an AWS user ec2-user.</description>
